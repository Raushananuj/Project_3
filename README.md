House Price Prediction Regression Project
1. find out the number of categorical features in our dataset.
2. We want to analyze the data to extract some insights
There are two major types of analysis data
● Univariate analysis
● Multivariate analysis
Univariate Analysis
● Univariate analysis is the simplest form of analyzing data.
● “Uni” means “one”, so in other words, data has only one variable.
● It doesn’t deal with causes or relationships and its major purpose is to
describe. It takes data, summarizes that data, and finds patterns in the data.
● Univariate Analysis can be done either on numerical or categorical
features.
3. Multivariate Analysis
In multivariate analysis, we try to find the relations between multiple variables.
Obviously, in real-life problems, variables can be any combination of numeric
or categorical variables. The combinations are:
● Numeric vs. Numeric
● Numeric vs. Categorical
● Categorical vs. Categorical
Another aspect of the variable combination is:
● Feature vs. Feature
● Feature vs. Target
4. Analysis of data with a variety of plots[Box plot,scatter plot,violin plot,bubble
plot,Histogram,Bar plot etc.,The Kernel Density Estimation
